/// let classification = Classification::new(2).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(Classification::Ground, classification);
/// assert_eq!(2, u8::from(classification));
/// ```
///
/// We make one modification to this table: we remove `OverlapPoints`, code 12. Las 1.4 added the
/// extended point formats, which include an overlap bit. The overlap bit is intended to allow a
/// point to both be an overlap point and contain some other classification.
///
/// Here's how we deal with that change:
///
/// - If the point format doesn't support the overlap bit, the classification is overwritten with
/// the code for overlap points (12). On ingest, points with an overlap classification are given
/// the `Unclassified` code and `Point::is_overlap` is set to `true`.
/// - If the point format does support the overlap bit, that is preferred.
///
/// Because of this change, trying to create a classification with code 12 is an error:
///
/// ```
/// use las::point::Classification;
/// assert!(Classification::new(12).is_err());
/// ```
